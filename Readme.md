# SolarPi

## Overview 

The SolarPi project focuses on harnessing solar energy to power a Raspberry Pi while incorporating it into a versatile setup as both a backend server and a weather station. The following aspects encapsulate the project's hardware and software components:

## Hardware Implementation

We provide a comprehensive list of components, accompanied by a schematic plan and photos showcasing the final product. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi serves as both a backend server and a weather station in this setup.

## Software Components

- Firstly, there's the code essential for Raspberry Pi operations, which includes functionalities like safely shutting down the Pi in case of low battery status, particularly crucial during the colder months, such as December and January, in Germany.
- Secondly, we delve into the code responsible for controlling various sensors measuring light, humidity, temperature, and more.
- Finally, we address the software dedicated to utilizing the Raspberry Pi as a backend server. This involves crafting code for both the Pi itself and our personal computers and smartphones. 

 ## Language Choice

 Throughout the entire project, the language of choice for coding is Rust, ensuring robust and efficient implementation.
